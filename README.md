**This project is a fun, interactive web page that displays random content to the user. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it features buttons that generate a random programmer meme, joke, inspirational quote, or riddle.**

**For this challenge, I implemented the core JavaScript logic to bring the page to life. This involved writing functions to handle button clicks, dynamically creating and inserting HTML elements into the DOM, and managing the display state. Key features I built include fetching random data, clearing the content area before displaying a new item, and implementing a "reveal answer" functionality for the riddles.**

**I hope you enjoy it!**

## User Story
<ol>
  <li>
    User should be able to click button on the right side of the screen to generate a random meme, joke, quote or riddle
  </li>
  <li>
    Only one piece of content should displayed at a time. e.g If the user clicks 'Show a meme' and there is a quote that showing already, the application should remove the quote and display a random meme.
  </li>
  <li>
    Content should be displayed under the appropriate heading(i.e a joke should not show up under the memes heading) So every content must displayed under the relevant heading.
  </li>
  <li>
    When showing a random riddle, the answer should never be revealed without the user explicitly clicks the button "Reveal Riddle Answer".
  </li>
  <li>
    If a user clicks "Reveal Riddle Answer" and there is no riddle, an alert should let them know they need to generate a riddle first.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a user clicks "Reveal Riddle Answer" and the answer already revealed, an alert should let them know that the answer is already revealed.
  </li>
</ol>
